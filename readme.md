### Cherry profile MX keycaps

This repo contains keycaps for .sldprt (Solidworks Part file) and .step keyboard models/assemblies.

In the .sldprt files, the top surface of the caps is a different color - this is used for material separation in rendering softwares, since the top surface of these caps is different than the sides.

Forked from original github, and converted most of the .stp files to .stl file for easy import to blender

The .step files are direct conversions from the .sldprt files. **I cannot, and will not, guarantee that these files are 3D-printable.**
